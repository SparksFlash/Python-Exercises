# Kaggle Python Course Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions and notes for the exercises in the [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python). The course covers foundational Python skills, including variables, functions, conditionals, and more, tailored for data science beginners. I’m using this repo to track my progress, store my code, and document what I’ve learned.

## About the Kaggle Python Course
The Kaggle Python course is a free, interactive tutorial designed to teach Python programming through hands-on exercises. Topics include:
- Variables and arithmetic operations
- Defining and using functions
- Booleans, conditionals, and loops
- Lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation
- Working with External Libraries

You can access the course here: [Kaggle Python Course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)

## Repository Structure
- `/exercises/`: Contains Python files for each exercise or lesson (e.g., `candy_sharing.py`, `rounding.py`).
- `/notes/`: Markdown or text files with my notes or explanations for each topic.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Setup
To run the code in this repository:
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed (download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SparksFlash/Python-Exercises
   ```
3. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd Python-Exercises
   ```
4. Run any Python file using:
   ```bash
   python exercises/<filename>.py
   ```

## Example Exercises
- **Candy Sharing**: Calculates leftover candies after dividing among friends (e.g., `to_smash(91)` returns `1` for 3 friends).
- **Rounding**: Rounds numbers to specific decimal places or multiples of 10 (e.g., `round_to_two_places(3.14159)` returns `3.14`).

## Progress
I’m currently working through the Kaggle Python course and updating this repository with each completed exercise. Check the `/exercises/` folder for my latest solutions.
